## Framework Selection Rationale

### Primary Framework: FastMCP 2.0
**Reasoning**:
1. **Production Ready**: Unlike experimental frameworks, FastMCP 2.0 is battle-tested
2. **Rapid Development**: Decorator-based approach allows quick tool synthesis
3. **Enterprise Features**: Authentication, middleware, and scaling capabilities
4. **Official Integration**: FastMCP 1.0 was incorporated into official MCP SDK
5. **Community**: Active development and comprehensive documentation

### Secondary Tools: Playwright MCP + Security Scanner
**Reasoning**:
1. **Web Security Focus**: Core requirement for security assessments
2. **Mature Technology**: Playwright is industry-standard for browser automation
3. **LLM Integration**: Specifically designed for AI agent interaction
4. **Evidence Collection**: Built-in screenshot and data capture

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core MCP Server (FastMCP)
- Implement basic tool registry using FastMCP decorators
- Set up authentication and middleware
- Create tool discovery and execution endpoints

### Phase 2: Security Tools Integration
- Integrate Playwright MCP for web security testing
- Add Web Security Scanner for vulnerability detection
- Integrate Shodan MCP for network reconnaissance and vulnerability intelligence
- Implement evidence collection and reporting

### Phase 3: Tool Synthesis Pipeline
- Use FastMCP's decorator system for rapid tool creation
- Implement offline sandbox validation
- Add static analysis and testing pipeline

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- Implement advanced authentication
- Add monitoring and logging middleware
- Scale to handle multiple concurrent assessments

## Technical Architecture

```python
# Example FastMCP Tool Structure
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("raid-security-tools")

@mcp.tool
async def scan_web_vulnerabilities(url: str, scan_types: list[str]) -> dict:
    """Scan web application for security vulnerabilities"""
    # Integrate with Playwright MCP and Security Scanner
    pass

@mcp.tool
async def synthesize_custom_tool(requirements: str) -> str:
    """Create custom security tool based on requirements"""
    # Tool synthesis pipeline
    pass
```

## Security Considerations

### MCP Security Framework
- Follow SlowMist security checklist
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use secure communication protocols
- Validate all tool inputs and outputs

### Tool Isolation
- Sandbox all synthesized tools
- Network restrictions per tool
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Kill switch capabilities

## Next Steps
